# Data map & dictionary — The Gammas

**What this is.** Everything under `data/`: provenance, layout, glossary. Raw data **gitignored** in both repos — only this doc travels.

> **TL;DR** — **4 folders + 1 atlas = 2 datasets**, not 4. Finalist A = one folder; Finalist B = one loader
> (`load_hcp`) unpacking into 3 folders + atlas. All official NMA/OSF downloads. Only local convention: the folder
> name `hcp_task_339`, so B's task data coexists with A's `hcp_task/`.

## 2 · Original NMA loaders

Only three are HCP-WM-relevant; the rest are vision/retinotopy studies rejected in
[`sandbox/jaime/00`](../sandbox/jaime/00_framing_and_dataset_choice.ipynb).

| Official loader | Subjects | **Delivers → folder(s) on disk** | What you get | Our verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`load_hcp_task_with_behaviour`](https://github.com/NeuromatchAcademy/course-content/blob/v3.0.2/projects/fMRI/load_hcp_task_with_behaviour.ipynb) | 100 (real IDs) | `hcp_task/` | 7 tasks' time series **+ per-subject `Stats.txt` behaviour** | **Finalist A** ✅ |
| [`load_hcp_task`](https://github.com/NeuromatchAcademy/course-content/blob/v3.0.2/projects/fMRI/load_hcp_task.ipynb) | 339 (pseudo IDs) | task-only component under its configured HCP directory | 7 tasks, **no behaviour**; same OSF task archive used by `load_hcp` | not a separate finalist; included within B |
| [`load_hcp`](https://github.com/NeuromatchAcademy/course-content/blob/v3.0.2/projects/fMRI/load_hcp.ipynb) | 339 (pseudo IDs) | official `hcp_task/` · `hcp_rest/` · `hcp/` · `atlas.npz`; locally renamed as described below | task **+ resting-state** + consolidated behaviour (`wm.csv`) + covariates + atlas | **Finalist B** ✅ |
| `load_hcp_retino` | — | — *(never downloaded)* | retinotopic mapping (not WM) | rejected |

> ⚠️ **Name trap (the one that bites).** Both `load_hcp_task` and `load_hcp` use the same
> **339-subject task archive**. `load_hcp_task` exposes only that component; Finalist B uses
> `load_hcp`, which adds resting-state, covariates/behaviour and the atlas. The official B task folder
> is `hcp_task/`; `_339` is a **local rename** so it can coexist with A's different 100-subject
> `hcp_task/`.

Folders are grouped by loader (`A_load_hcp_task_with_behaviour/`, `B_load_hcp/`); `datasets.py`
resolves the grouped layout and falls back to the legacy flat layout automatically. The leaf folder
names below (`hcp_task/`, `hcp_task_339/`, …) are unchanged.

Folder → what's *uniquely* in it (loader and subject count are in §2):

| Folder | Dataset | IDs | What's unique to this folder |
|---|---|---|---|
| `hcp_task/` | **A** | real HCP (`100307`) | task time series **with `Stats.txt`** behaviour alongside |
| `hcp_task_339/` | **B** | pseudo (`0…338`) | task time series — EVs and timeseries **split into separate branches** |
| `hcp_rest/` | **B** | pseudo | **resting-state** (4 runs × 1200 frames) |
| `hcp/` | **B** | pseudo | `behavior/*.csv` (incl. `wm.csv`), `pseudo_demographics.npy`, `orig_ids.txt` |
| `hcp_atlas_339.npz` | **B** | — | ROI 3-D coords + surface vertex→ROI labels |

## 4 · Folder structures

**A vs B packaging:** both derive from HCP Young Adult and use the same task/parcellation logic, but
they are **different NMA-curated subsets**, not identical cohorts. A keeps each task's time series + EVs
together; B splits them (`EVs/`, `timeseries/`) and moves behaviour to a central CSV.

### Finalist A — `hcp_task/`

## 6 · Nomenclature glossary

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **ROI** | *Region Of Interest* — one of the 360 Glasser cortical parcels. In graph language, a **node**. |
| **frame** | One fMRI time point (= one whole-brain volume), sampled every **TR**. WM run = 405 frames ≈ 291 s. |
| **TR** | *Repetition Time* = 0.72 s here (time between frames). |
| **`.npy`** | NumPy's binary array format (preserves shape + dtype). Load with `np.load`. |
| **`.npz`** | A zip of several named `.npy` arrays. `hcp_atlas_339.npz` holds 3 (`coords`, `labels_R`, `labels_L`). |
| **EV** | *Explanatory Variable* — FSL timing file, 3 columns: **onset(s) · duration(s) · amplitude**. Says *when* a condition happens. |
| **LR / RL** | The two **phase-encoding directions** (Left→Right, Right→Left). HCP scans every task **twice** with opposite directions to cancel geometric distortion. Same task content, different acquisition geometry — that is why every task has two `tfMRI_<TASK>_<LR|RL>` folders. We concatenate both for more frames / more stable FC. |
| **tfMRI** | *task fMRI* (vs. resting-state). |
| **MSMAll** | *Multimodal Surface Matching* — HCP's cross-subject surface registration (appears in the timeseries filenames). |
| **Glasser360Cortical** | The parcellation used for the timeseries. |
| **ACC** | *Accuracy* — fraction of correct responses. In the files it is a per-condition **Median ACC**. |
| **RT** | *Reaction Time* (ms). |

### EV condition names, by task
Only **WM** matters for us; the others come bundled in B and are noise for this project.

| Task | EV files | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **WM** ✅ | `0bk_/2bk_ × {body,faces,places,tools}` | 8 conditions = 2 loads × 4 stimulus categories |
| | `0bk_cor/err/nlr`, `2bk_…`, `all_bk_cor/err` | trial outcomes: correct / error / no-response |
| | `Stats.txt`, `Sync.txt` | behaviour summary (A only) / scanner sync timing |
| EMOTION | `fear`, `neut` | fearful vs neutral faces |
| GAMBLING | `win`, `loss`, `neut`, `*_event` | reward/punishment; block (`win`) vs event-related (`win_event`) |
| LANGUAGE | `story`, `math`, `cue`, `present_/question_/response_*` | listen to stories vs solve arithmetic |
| MOTOR | `lf`, `lh`, `rf`, `rh`, `t`, `cue` | left/right foot, left/right hand, tongue |
| RELATIONAL | `match`, `relation`, `error` | relational reasoning conditions |

---

## 7 · Prediction target — `acc_2bk`

**The N-back task.** Subjects see a stream of images (body / faces / places / tools) and respond under two loads:
- **0-back (low load):** "does this match a *fixed* target shown at block start?" — an attention/perception control; near-ceiling.
- **2-back (high load):** "does this match the image *2 positions back*?" — requires holding + updating a memory buffer; this is genuine working memory, and where people **differ**.

**`acc_2bk` = mean 2-back accuracy per subject.** In A it is parsed from `Stats.txt` (`_parse_stats` → `behaviour_table`),
averaging *Median ACC* over the 4 categories × 2 runs. In B the same number comes from `wm.csv`
(`groupby(Subject, load).ACC.mean()` on `2BK`). Candidate targets exposed by `behaviour_table`:

| Target | Definition | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `acc_0bk` | mean 0-back accuracy | near-ceiling (≈0.93) → little variance to predict |
| **`acc_2bk`** | mean 2-back accuracy | **primary candidate**: A ≈ 0.54–0.99; B ≈ 0.41–1.00 after excluding 3 subjects without complete 2-back |
| `acc_cost` | `acc_2bk − acc_0bk` | *load cost* (mostly < 0) |
| `rt_2bk`, `rt_cost` | median reaction time (ms) | speed alternatives |

Caveat for the modelling step: `acc_2bk` is a bounded proportion with a ceiling — not Gaussian; worth noting as a
limitation (or a logit transform) when we fit the predictor.

## 8 · Atlas file — `hcp_atlas_339.npz`

`hcp_atlas_339.npz` — **not yet used** by any notebook or the `datasets`/`preprocessing` loaders. The *spatial* description the rest of the data lacks:

- **`coords` (360, 3)** — 3-D centroid per ROI. Anatomical node layout for graphs (steps 3–4), instead of an arbitrary circle.
- **`labels_R` / `labels_L` (10242,)** — surface vertex → ROI map (fsaverage5). Paints any per-ROI value onto a brain surface (e.g. where 0→2-back reconfiguration is strongest).

> Proposed use: `atlas_geometry` demo plotting the 360 ROIs by network from `coords`, as an anatomical skeleton for the graph team. (Figure pending.)

## 9 · A vs B decision

| | **A — `hcp_task`** | **B — `hcp` (load_hcp)** |
|---|---|---|
| Subjects | 100 | **339** (3.4×) |
| Task time series | ✅ | ✅ (**confirmed present** — 4 746 run-level `.npy`) |
| Resting-state | ❌ | ✅ (unlocks abstract Objective 2) |
| WM behaviour | `Stats.txt` per subject | `wm.csv` consolidated (comparable, not coarser) |
| Subject IDs | real HCP | pseudo (`0…338`, mapped by `orig_ids.txt`) |
| Ingestion status | **done** (tasks 1–2 run) | **done and verified** (339 total; 336 analytic) |

**Bottom line:** both finalists are ingested and can be compared directly. B provides 3.4× total subjects
(336 analytically complete) **and** resting-state; the final A/B decision remains a team decision. Full costing:
[`sandbox/jaime/00`](../sandbox/jaime/00_framing_and_dataset_choice.ipynb).

> **Cohort overlap (verified).** A and B are **mostly independent** cohorts, not nested: only **35 subjects
> are shared** (A = 100, B = 339; 404 unique people in total), checked by cross-referencing A's real IDs
> (`subjects_list.txt`) against B's pseudo→real map (`orig_ids.txt`). Consequence: pooling A∪B would add only
> ~65 subjects over B while forcing two heterogeneous pipelines together and deduplicating the 35 overlap to
> avoid leakage — so **B on its own is the clean path**. Reproduced in
> [`sandbox/jaime/03` §6](../sandbox/jaime/03_dataset_comparison.ipynb).
